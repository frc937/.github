We're FRC Team 937, a FIRST Robotics Competition Team from Shawnee Mission North High School in Overland Park, Kansas.

We're all about open source, so any of our code is free for others to use and take inspiration from! (Though, per the [WPILib License](https://github.com/frc937/robot2023/blob/main/WPILib-License.md), all redistributions, binary or source, must bear the WPILib copyright notice).

Our robot code repository for each year will be in a repo called `robot(year)`. All of the other repositories on this account are other side projects of ours.

### Documentation
Our programming guidelines, newbie onboarding, and all other documentation can be found on [our GitBook](https://frc937.gitbook.io/frc-team-937/v/programming).
